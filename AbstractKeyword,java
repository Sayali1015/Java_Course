//Abstract class is used to achieve abstraction in java. It can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. 
// An abstract method is a method that does not have a body and it is declared with the abstract keyword. 
// The subclasses that extend the abstract class must provide an implementation for the abstract methods. 
// An abstract class can also have constructors, instance variables, and static methods. 
// It cannot be instantiated but it can be subclassed.
//All the abstract methods must be implemented in the subclass otherwise the subclass will also be an abstract class.

It is just a blueprint for the subclasses to implement the abstract methods. So we cannot create an object of an abstract class but we can create a reference variable of an abstract class.
